## About Me

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on hands-on learning and offensive security techniques. My work centers around building practical lab environments and understanding real-world attack and detection methods.

This site documents my personal cybersecurity projects and TryHackMe writeups, including Wi-Fi security labs, log analysis, and threat investigation workflows.  

## Purpose of this Site

This portfolio serves as a structured documentation of my learning journey, projects and technical experiments. All projects are conducted in controlled lab environments for educational purposes.
